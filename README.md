GhostCoop is a package for quick and accurate approximation of one-dimensional chaotic dynamical systems. It is geared towards spectral methods* and uses spectral methods^‚Ä† for its numerical implementation.


 <!---computes transfer operators of one-dimensional chaotic systems in spectral bases. This enables one to find statistical properties of dynamical systems quickly, reliably and abstractly.

Take your favourite Markov uniformly expanding dynamical system and create a numerical representation of it:

```julia
using GhostCoop, ApproxFun
d = Interval(0,1)
M = MarkovMap(d,[x->2x+sin(2pi*x)/8,x->2-2x],[0,1/2,1])
M(0.25), M'(0.25)
```
<!---want to plot Markov Map--->

GhostCoop closely interfaces with the adaptive function approximation package [ApproxFun](https://github.com/ApproxFun/ApproxFun.jl). Calling ```Transfer``` on a ```MarkovMap``` automatically creates a calculable computer representation of the transfer operator in a Chebyshev basis. Transfer operators are instantiated as Operator types, and can do (numerically) all the kinds of things one expects from linear operators on function spaces:

```julia
L = Transfer(M)
f0 = Fun(x->sin(3pi*x),d) #ApproxFun function
f1 = L*f0
g = ((2I-L)\f0)'
sum(f1*Fun(sin,d)) # sum is total integral
sum(f1*Fun(sin,d)) - sum(f0*Fun(x->sin(M(x)),d)) #definition of transfer operator as adjoint
``` 

GhostCoop has built-in commands for calculating many standard dynamical objects:

```julia
œÅ = acim(L) # acim(M) also works but L is already cached
norm(L*œÅ-œÅ)
using Plots
plot(œÅ)
```
<!--- plot!(linearresponse(L,Fun(x->x*(1-x),d))) --->

These have spectral accuracy: one can calculate acims to 15 digits of accuracy in a fraction of a second:

```julia
doubling = MarkovMap(Interval(0,1),[x->2x,x->2x-1],[0,0.5,1])
norm(acim(doubling)-1) #doubling map
```
